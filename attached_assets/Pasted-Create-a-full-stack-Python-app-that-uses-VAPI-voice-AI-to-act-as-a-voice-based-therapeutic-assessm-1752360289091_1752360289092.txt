Create a full-stack Python app that uses VAPI (voice AI) to act as a voice-based therapeutic assessment agent.

‚ú® Functional Overview:
1. The app allows a user to upload a Zoom therapy session audio file (MP3, WAV).
2. The app transcribes the session using OpenAI Whisper API (or another speech-to-text service).
3. Once transcribed, the app analyzes the content using AI and NLP models.
4. The analysis uses a custom framework inspired by:
   - Carl Rogers (empathy, genuineness, positive regard)
   - Sigmund Freud (unconscious material, symbolic language)
   - Albert Ellis & Aaron Beck (CBT, REBT ‚Äì belief reframe, irrational thought detection)
   - Melanie Klein (early experience, symbolic processing)
   - Virginia Satir (family dynamics, communication)
   - Martin Seligman (positive psychology, strength use, PERMA model)

üìà Assessment Output:
- The app should output a structured report with 7 domain scores:
   1. Emotional safety & relational depth (Rogers)
   2. Unconscious pattern emergence (Freud, Klein)
   3. Cognitive restructuring (Ellis, Beck)
   4. Communication/family role changes (Satir)
   5. Strengths and well-being (Seligman)
   6. Narrative/identity coherence
   7. Behavioral activation in real life

üé§ Voice-based interface (via VAPI):
- A voice agent allows the user to ask: ‚ÄúAm I making progress in therapy?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat themes came up in today‚Äôs session?‚Äù
- The agent responds using GPT-based summarization of the session, using therapeutic language informed by the above theorists.

üì¶ Stack:
- Python (Flask or FastAPI backend)
- VAPI for voice interaction
- OpenAI Whisper or AssemblyAI for transcription
- OpenAI GPT-4 API for analysis
- HTML/JS frontend or Streamlit (optional)
- Replit-hosted for easy deployment

üí° Bonus:
- Allow download of a PDF progress report
- Track scores over time (session history)
- Optional: Zoom API integration to auto-fetch recordings

Ensure the app respects user privacy and stores files securely. Use encrypted storage or allow local-only processing mode.
